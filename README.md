# jump-start-kit

Sometimes getting started is the hardest part. That’s why I made this collection of some generic stuff I use on almost every new project. There are a handful of SCSS files set up with my commonly used extensions, base styles, and layout rules. I’ve included my column-sizing functions, including the overlay markers. Plus there’s a sample hero component to get you started.

There’s not much here so I’ll likely add more in the future. But this should hold you over for now.
